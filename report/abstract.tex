Smartphones are becoming more significant in storing and transferring data.
However, techniques ensuring this data is not compromised after a confiscation of the device are not readily available. 
DroidStealth is an open source Android application which combines data encryption and application obfuscation techniques to provide users with a way to securely hide content on their smartphones.
This includes hiding the application's default launch methods and providing methods such as dial-to-launch or invisible launch buttons. 
A novel technique provided by DroidStealth is the ability to transform its appearance to be able to hide in plain sight on devices. 
To achieve this, it uses self-compilation, without requiring any special permissions.
This Two-Layer protection aims to protect the user and its data from casual search in various situations.
